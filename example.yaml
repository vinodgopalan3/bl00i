# DUMMY YAML definition of example IOC
#
# In future this will contain a YAML definition of this IOC
# and ibek (IOC Builder for EPICS in Kubernetes) will generate
# the helm charts in iocs folder from this definition.

# This file is just a placeholder to demonstrate that we will require
# a single YAML file per IOC in the root of the beamline repo to describe
# all of the IOCs. The iocs folder will be an output folder only with its
# contents generated by ibek.
